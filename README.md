## Overview

Smart Mobility and Delivery Solution is an innovative platform addressing transportation and logistics challenges in Nigerian cities. By leveraging AI and Operations Research, we enable auto-rickshaw (keke napep) and motorcycle (okada) operators to optimize their operations while providing dual-purpose services - passenger transport and delivery.

Our solution bridges the gap between traditional transportation services and modern logistics demands, helping operators maximize their earning potential while providing reliable services to customers.
